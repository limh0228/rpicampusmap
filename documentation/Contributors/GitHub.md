# GitHub Tutorial
RPI Campus Map and RPI Machines Map are both hosted on GitHub so 
it is important for you to be familiar with GitHub and Git
in order to contribute to either projects.

## Step 0: Create GitHub account and install git
If you don't have a GitHub account, then you can sign up for a free account
at ![GitHub)](https://github.com/). This will give you permission to make 
changes to the project later on.

Once you have a GitHub account, download Git 
![here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You will be using Git to share your changes with everyone else.

### Git Terminology:
In order to make sure everyone is on the same page, here are some Git terminology
that you should use so everyone knows what you're saying.

After you make any changes to the project, you will need to publish your 
changes using Git so everyone else working on the project can see your
changes. Publishing your changes is called "pushing". 
For example, after you fixed a bug on the program and you "pushed" it on Git,
you'll tell the other people that you "pushed" the changes and they should
go check it out.
